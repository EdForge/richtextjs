# Welcome to RichTextJS
A standalone rich text editor with no external dependencies and based entirely on the HTML5 canvas.

# Why ?
I could not have imagined developing a rich text editor some time ago ... but I do need a full featured rich text editor for my VisualGraphics.tv application framework. And nothing I found fits the bill.

RichTextJS is inspired by (but does not share any code with) [Carota](https://github.com/danielearwicker/carota).

# Missing features
We are at the start of the development cycle, so there are quite a few missing features.

* Undo / redo and clipboard support
* HTML import, Markdown export
* Arrows keys
* Links (internal and external)
* Multiple columns
* Bugfixes and more

# How to use RichTextJS
Coming soon ... in the meantime please have a look at the example in index.html
